# CpGValues
 I have completed a course in Bioinformatics during my exchange semester, where I had to develop a predictive model to determine the smoking status of individuals based on various input values, including age, gender, and methylation values at specific CpG sites. For this, I used R and Stan, leveraging Bayesian modeling techniques to effectively interpret the data. Within the scope of the project, I preprocessed the dataset, visualized the effects of different inputs, and implemented a probabilistic model that determined smoking status. Through this project, I gained experience in statistical modeling, Bayesian inference, and computational analysis in R.
